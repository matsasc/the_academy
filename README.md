The Academy
===========

This is where some code will eventually appear.. 
(Ehm.. We have some code now..)

Project goal
------------

Develop a Screenshot-utility for DHIS2 and a photo-gallery display of all screenshots.


Project status
--------------
 - Backend-service: pretty much done
 - Screenshot: working in the django-based test-server. Not yet tested with our actual DHIS2-service..
 - Gallery: Needs integration with apis as soon as the server is up and running, but otherwise close to done.
 
TODOs
------
 - merge backend and frontend (apis are defined, just need to combine the three separate parts)
 - package gallery as a DHIS2 web-app
 - add screenshot-button to an appropriate DHIS2-view as proof-of-concept
